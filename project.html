       <h2>Unemployment. The Potential Causes and Impacts</h2>
    
       <h3>Unemployment tends fluctuate in the UK, this could be a result of many reasons such as redundancies, wage changes, changes to the benefit system, growth in self-employment, job opportunities through schooling, the change in contracts offered within jobs, seasonal fluctuations, change in GDP, as well as many other reasons. Unemployment as a whole tends to objectively give a bad signal for the economy. It is thought that the potential impacts of unemployment could possibly be both social and economic. This project will outline the current state of the UK's unemployment rates, possible causes and some potential impacts, with the aim and objective to demonstrate this through real data to code charts and conclude accordingly.</h3>
    
       <h3> Chart 1 - Unemployment Rates</h3>
           
       <p>Since 1971 the UK have experienced a variety of peaks and troughs, with the highest peak reaching almost 12% in the early stages of 1984. Since then, however it is clear that the unemployment rate has had an overall decline with taking into consideration the peak due to the after math of the 2007/08 financial crisis and the impact of Covid 19. Currently the rate is the lowest it has been for many decades at around 4%. The question is what impacts, if any, has this had?</p>

       <h3> Chart 2 - Unemployment and Schooling</h3>
       
       <p>A potential cause to consider for the unemployment rate to fluctuate would be schooling, this is because if the proportion of students attending school drops it firstly effects the student in later life obtaining a job with no qualifications but also if parents have to stay at home and care for their children (unless they work from home) they cannot have a job and would therefore be deemed unemployed. The chart below displays range of countries around the world with their unemployment rates and school enrolment. The UK in 2022 sits in a good position compared to other countries with a school enrolment of 69.48% and an unemployment rate of 4%.</p>

       <h3> Chart 3 - Business Closures</h3>
    
       <p>It is clear that business closures link to unemployment as if a business closes down then a employee could be unemployed, however we must considered that a lot of employees may have work already lined up. The trend of the graph from 2020-2022 is very coherent with the trend in chart 1 showing that they is a link between the two.</p>

       <h3> Chart 4 - Annual Earnings vs House Prices</h3>
    
       <p> Gross annual earnings have not risen in pair with house prices, the issue with this is that there will be a higher demand for areas with cheaper houses which tend to have high unemployment levels. In turn this could potentially push lower skilled workers out of jobs and be replaced by higher skilled workers that now live within the area for convenience.</p>
      <div class="chart" id="Chart4"></div>
    
    <a href= "chart22_EarningsvsHousePrices.json" class="link" id="link">Github</a href>
    
    
    
       <h3> Chart 5 - Crimes</h3>
    
       <p> From the charts below we cannot defer that unemployment is the causality of crime, however it is clear that total crime increased during a period of time that unemployment increased, notably in particular drug offences which could imply the social impact of the rise such as mental wellbeing.</p> 
    
    <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div>   
    
    
   <h3>Data</h3>
       <p> All of my data that I used I downloaded as a csv file from The World Bank and ONS. I found it difficult finding relevant data and this proved as I did want to find unemployment rates over time in relation to wpc and produce a map with sliding year bar and further investigate high unemployment rated areas to distinguish the impact. </p> 
           
       
    <h3>Data Cleaning</h3>    
       <p>For data cleaning I used a mix of both collab and excel depending on which data I used and the size of the data set. The majority of my datasets were very large and therefore the tools of adding new components and cleaning the data, using python, were much needed to ensure I could then code in Vega-lite. Additionally I used excel to create formulars to defer new variables such as the data for the unemployment chart.</p>    
           
       
    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
       <p>Overall unemployment itself has declined and from the charts it would show that this can be a positive for housing prices as individuals themselves when deciding where to live and in turn benefit the economy for high skilled workers to remain in jobs that would gain the highest productivity. Even though schooling may not be a direct cause for lower levels of unemployment, it can be implied when comparing to other countries the importance behind it. I feel like business closures is a good example of a cause in an increase in unemployment rates. Notibaly crime has increased, I do not see a direct link from the crime levels increasing to unemployment and therefore I would not consider this a major impact.</p>
