       <h2> Unemployment. The Potential Causes and Impacts</h2>
    
       <h1>Unemployment tends fluctuate in the UK, this could be a result of many reasons such as redundancies, wage changes, changes to the benefit system, growth in self-employment, job opportunities through schooling, the change in contracts offered within jobs, seasonal fluctuations, change in GDP, as well as many other reasons. Unemployment as a whole tends to objectively give a bad signal for the economy. It is thought that the potential impacts of unemployment could possibly be both socially and economically. This project will outline the current state of the UK's unemployment, possible causes and some of the potential impacts, with the aim and objective to demonstrate this through real data to code charts and give overall plausable conclusion on what the causes and impacts really are.</h1>
    
       <h3> Chart 1 - Unemployment Rates</h3>
           
       <p>Since 1971 the UK have experienced a variety of peaks and troughs, with the highest peak reaching almost 12% in the early stages of 1984. Since then however it is clear that the unemployment rate has had an overall decline with taking into consideration the peak due to the after math of the 2007/08 finanical crisis and the impact of Covid 19. Currently the rate is the lowest it has been for many decades at around 4%. The question is what impacts, if any, has this had?</p>

       <h3> Chart 2 - Unemployment and Schooling</h3>
       
       <p>A cause for the unemployment rate to fluctuate would be schooling, this is because if the proportion of students attending school drops it firstly efttects the student in later life obtaining a job with no qualifications but also if parents have to stay at home and care for their children, unless they work from home, they cannot have a job and would therefore be deemed unemployed. The chart below displays range of countries around the world with their unemployment rates and school enrollment. The UK in 2022 sits in a good position compared to other countries with a school enrollment of 69.48% and an unemployment rate of 4%.</p>

       <h3> Chart 3 - Annual Earnings vs House Prices</h3>
       <p> Gross annual earnings have not risen in pair with house prices, the issue with this is that there will be a higher demand for areas with cheaper houses which tend to have high unemployment levels. In turn this could potentially push lower skilled workers out of jobs and be replaced by higher skilled workers that now live within the area for convience.
