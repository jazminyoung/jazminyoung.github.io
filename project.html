       <h1> Impact of Unemployment</h1>
    
       <p>Unemployment tends fluctuate in the UK, this could be a result of many reasons such as redundancies, wage changes, changes to the benefit system, growth in self-employment, the change in contracts offered within jobs, seasonal fluctuations, change in GDP, as well as many other reasons. Unemployment as a whole tends to objectively give a bad signal for the economy. It is thought that the potential impacts of unemployment could possibly be both socially and economically. This project will outline some of the potential impacts, with the aim and objective to demonstrate whether this could be true by using real data to code charts.</p>
    
       <h3> Chart 1 - Unemployment Rates</h3>
           
       <p>Since 1971 the UK have experienced a variety of peaks and troughs, with the highest peak reaching almost 12% in the early stages of 1984. Since then however it is clear that the unemployment rate has had an overall decline with taking into consideration the peak due to the after math of the 2007/08 finanical crisis and the impact of Covid 19. Currently the rate is the lowest it has been for many decades at 3.8%. The question is what impacts, if any, has this had?</p>
